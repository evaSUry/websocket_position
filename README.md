**WebSocket Position Tracker**

-This is a simple proof-of-concept app for tracking positions in real-time using WebSockets. It lets users move names around a board while keeping everything synced across clients.

**Features**

-Uses Socket.io to send and receive real-time position updates.

-Prevents unnecessary re-renders so only the changed positions update.

-Handles cases where two names try to take the same spot.

**How to Run It**

1. Clone this repo:
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/websocket-position.git](https://github.com/evaSUry/websocket_position.git)

cd websocket-positions

3. Install dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the backend:
cd server
node server/index.js

5. Start the frontend:
cd ..
cd client
npm start

6. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

**Tech Stack**

-React with Recoil for managing state.

-Socket.io for real-time updates.

-Express for the server.

Notes

-This was built as a quick technical assignment to demonstrate WebSockets and state management. Let me know if youâ€™d like any changes or additions!
