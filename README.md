**WebSocket Position Tracker**

-This is a simple proof-of-concept app for tracking positions in real-time using WebSockets. It lets users move names around a board while keeping everything synced across clients.

**Features**

-Uses Socket.io to send and receive real-time position updates.

-Prevents unnecessary re-renders so only the changed positions update.

-Handles cases where two names try to take the same spot.

**How to Run It**

1. Clone this repo:
  git clone [https://github.com/your-username/websocket-position.git](https://github.com/evaSUry/websocket_position.git)
  cd websocket-position

2. Install dependencies:
  cd client && npm install
  cd ../server && npm install

3. Start the backend:
  node index.js

4. Start the frontend (from a seperate terminal window): 
  cd client
  npm start

5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

**Tech Stack**

-React with Recoil for managing state.

-Socket.io for real-time updates.

-Express for the server.

Notes

-This was built as a quick technical assignment to demonstrate WebSockets and state management. Let me know if youâ€™d like any changes or additions!
